Code to create pseudo ensemble members for the LETKF-OI. 

change input variables at top of make_letkf_pseudoens.sh: 
dir_in - directory with input enemble (ie., the forecast) 
fstub - stub for file names (eveything before sfc_data.tile$n.nc this is usually the date) 
b - desired background error 
nens - number of ensemble members to be generated.

Currently using 3 ensemble members, as JEDI applies QC to the last ensemble member: 
mem_pos (has +ve increment added) 
mem_neg (has -ve increment added) 
mem_det (unperturbed  - make sure this is listed last in the DA yaml) 

Once JEDI has been updated to apply QC to the ensemble mean, we can revert to 2 ensemble members (pos and neg).  

The perturbation applied is different for the 2 and 3 ensemble member cases. Set the n_ens in make_letkf_pseudoens.sh to the appropriate number of ensemble members, and the  appropirate perturbation will be calculated.

There is a C48 test case here:
